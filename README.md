# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
  During previous work, we analyzed the outcomes of the fundraisings based on launch dates and other factors. In this current project, we used multiple tools to analyze the given datasheet, which could help Louise understand the relations between the outcomes of theatre fundraising based on launch date, and the outcomes based on goals for plays. 

### Purpose
  Our purpose is to help Louise visualize the outcomes of theatre fundraising based on launch date and the outcomes based on goals for plays by analyzing the data and making line charts accordingly.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  One of the major challenges during this project is the Countif input for each cell. Since each cell needs different specifications of conditions, each needs to be inputed individually, which was very time consuming and allowed some space for manual errors. 
  
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  One conclusion we had for this part of the analysis was that May would be the best month to launch theatre fundraisings, because May gives the highest amount of success. Another conclusion we had was that the number of failed and canceled fundraisings remain mostly unchanged throughout the year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  One conclusion we had for this part of the analysis was that, the higher the goal, the higher the percentage for failing. If a fundraise is hope to be succeeded, it's recommended to have a lower goal. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  Our dataset does not show how much the design of blurb affects the net fund raised.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create
  We could have created tables on the relation of outcomes in accordance to the spotlight and staff-pick status based on the goal amount.
